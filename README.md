# FashionHub — LUNORA

A fashion storefront: an Express + SQLite API and a **framework-free** Vite/TypeScript frontend.

```
backend/    Express 4 · better-sqlite3 · JWT · Zod · Helmet · rate limiting
frontend/   Vite 5 · TypeScript (strict) · 6 static HTML pages · no UI framework
```

---

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Install everything and create + seed the database
npm run setup

# 2. Configure the API
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env      # then edit JWT_SECRET

# 3. Run the API (:3001) and the dev server (:5173) together
npm run dev
```

Open **http://localhost:5173**. The Vite dev server proxies `/api/*` to the backend, so
there is no CORS setup to do in development.

### Pages

| Page | What's on it |
|---|---|
| `index.html` | Hero, categories, featured grid, newsletter |
| `shop.html` | Search, category/price/availability filters, sorting, full grid |
| `product.html?id=…` | Detail view with size/colour variants and stock |
| `checkout.html` | Address + card, server-computed totals, two-step payment |
| `order-success.html?id=…` | Confirmation — re-reads the order from the API |
| `account.html` | Sign in / register, profile, password, order history, wishlist |
| `admin.html` | **Store admin** — dashboard, products, homepage content, orders, subscribers |
| `lookbook.html` | Editorial content |

> `npm run setup` runs `npm install` in both `backend/` and `frontend/`, then
> `npm run db:setup` (migrate + seed). Re-running it is safe.

### Useful commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | API + web together, colourised and prefixed |
| `npm run dev:backend` / `dev:frontend` | One tier only |
| `npm run build` | Typecheck + production build into `frontend/dist` |
| `npm run preview` | Serve the built site |
| `npm run test` | Unit tests (Vitest) **and** API integration tests |
| `npm run test:unit` | Frontend logic only — no server needed |
| `npm run test:api` | Integration suite — needs a running API (see below) |
| `npm run lint` / `typecheck` | ESLint / `tsc --noEmit` |
| `npm run verify` | typecheck → lint → build → unit tests |
| `npm run db:migrate` / `db:seed` | Apply migrations / reload the catalogue |
| `npm run db:promote -- you@example.com` | Grant an account the `admin` role |

### Running the API tests

They talk to a **live server**, so start one first on a throwaway database:

```bash
cd backend
npm run db:setup          # creates/overwrites backend/fashionhub.db
npm run dev
# in another terminal:
npm run test:api          # or BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001 node --test backend/tests/
```

They create users, carts and orders — never point them at a database you care about.

---

## Environment

All configuration lives in `backend/.env` (see `backend/.env.example`).

| Variable | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `PORT` | `3001` | |
| `JWT_SECRET` | dev fallback | **Required** when `NODE_ENV=production` — the server refuses to boot without it |
| `JWT_EXPIRES_IN` | `7d` | |
| `CORS_ORIGINS` | `localhost:5173,localhost:3000` | Comma-separated |
| `AUTH_RATE_LIMIT` / `AUTH_RATE_WINDOW_MS` | `100` / `900000` | Raise these for test runs |
| `DB_PATH` | `backend/fashionhub.db` | |
| `SERVE_STATIC` | `false` | Set `true` to let Express also serve `frontend/dist` on one origin |
| `PAYMENT_PROVIDER` | `demo` | `demo` (simulated gateway) or `stripe` |
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | – | Required when `PAYMENT_PROVIDER=stripe` |
| `API_URL` (frontend) | `http://localhost:3001` | Vite dev proxy target |

### Backend layout

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `server.js` | App assembly: Helmet/CSP, CORS, JSON limit, rate limiting, route mounting, 404 + error handlers, graceful shutdown |
| `config.js` | Every env var in one typed object |
| `db.js` | The single `better-sqlite3` handle (WAL, foreign keys on) |
| `middleware/auth.js` | `authMiddleware`, `optionalAuth`, `requireRole`, `requireAdmin`, `signToken` |
| `middleware/validate.js` | Zod schemas + the `validate()` middleware |
| `services/cart.js` | Cart identity, queries, stock lookups, guest→user merge |
| `services/pricing.js` | **The** place order maths lives (subtotal, shipping, tax, total) |
| `services/payments.js` | Gateway abstraction + the `demo` and `stripe` drivers |
| `services/orderStatus.js` | Order lifecycle constants and predicates |
| `services/settings.js` | Editable homepage copy: defaults, allowed keys, read/write |
| `routes/*` | `auth`, `products`, `cart`, `orders`, `subscribers`, `admin` |
| `db/migrations/` | Numbered, transactional migrations |
| `tests/api.test.mjs` | 39 integration tests, Node's built-in runner, zero extra deps |

### Frontend layout

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `src/main.ts` | Bootstraps every page: loads cart + catalogue in parallel, wires UI, registers the service worker |
| `src/api/client.ts` | Typed `fetch` wrapper; injects the session id and bearer token; throws `ApiError` |
| `src/features/products/` | `catalog` (API → cache → defaults), `filters` (pure), `render` (cards, grid, detail, variants), `search-ui` |
| `src/features/cart/` | `state` (store + offline fallback) and `ui` (drawer, focus trap) |
| `src/features/auth/` | `session` (auth store), `header` (account menu), `Newsletter` |
| `src/features/admin/` | `views.ts` — every admin panel render function |
| `src/features/content/` | `siteSettings.ts` — applies admin copy to the public pages |
| `src/bootstrap.ts` | The boot sequence shared by every page, including checkout |
| `src/pages/` | `account.ts`, `admin.ts`, `checkout.ts`, `order-success.ts` — page entry points |
| `src/utils/` | `escape` (XSS), `pricing` (offline mirror of the server rules), `storage`, `format`, `images` |
| `src/types/` | `product.ts` and `cart.ts` — shared shapes mirroring the API |

### Data model

`users` · `products` · `product_variants` (size/colour/SKU/stock) · `cart_items` ·
`orders` · `order_items` (price snapshot) · `subscribers` · `migrations`

Carts are keyed by **either** `user_id` **or** `session_id`, so guests can shop without
an account; on login the guest cart is merged into the account.

## API

| Method | Path | Auth | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/health` | – | |
| `POST` | `/api/auth/register` | – | Returns `{token, user, cartMerged}`; adopts the guest cart |
| `POST` | `/api/auth/login` | – | Adopts the guest cart |
| `GET` | `/api/auth/me` | bearer | Re-validates the token on boot |
| `PATCH` | `/api/auth/me` | bearer | Update first/last name (partial) |
| `POST` | `/api/auth/password` | bearer | Change password; returns a fresh token |
| `GET` | `/api/products` | – | `category`, `search`, `sort`, `minPrice`, `maxPrice`, `featured`, `limit`, `offset`; total in `X-Total-Count`. **Unpublished products are hidden** unless you send an admin token |
| `GET` | `/api/products/meta/categories` | – | Categories with counts — drives the filter list |
| `GET` | `/api/products/:id` | – | Includes `variants` |
| `GET` | `/api/products/:id/variants` | – | |
| `GET` `POST` `PATCH` `DELETE` | `/api/cart[/:itemId]` | optional | Works for guests via `X-Session-Id` |
| `POST` | `/api/orders` | optional | Creates a `pending_payment` order, reserves stock, returns a payment intent |
| `POST` | `/api/orders/:id/pay` | owner | Authorises with the gateway → `paid`; `402` on decline |
| `POST` | `/api/orders/:id/cancel` | owner | Cancels an unpaid order and **returns the reserved stock** |
| `GET` | `/api/orders` | bearer | The user's orders |
| `GET` | `/api/orders/:id` | owner | The buyer **or** the guest session that placed it |
| `GET` `POST` `PUT` `DELETE` | `/api/wishlist[/:productId]` | bearer | Server-side wishlist; `PUT` bulk-replaces |
| `POST` | `/api/subscribers` | – | Rate limited, idempotent |
| `GET` | `/api/settings` | – | Public homepage copy — see *Store admin* below |
| `GET` | `/api/store-config` | – | Public payment mode + pricing rules |
| `*` | `/api/admin/*` | **admin role** | See below |

### Admin endpoints

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/admin/stats` | Revenue, order/product/customer counts, low-stock list |
| `GET` `POST` | `/api/admin/products` | List all (including hidden) / upsert. **Partial updates** — send only the keys you want to change |
| `DELETE` | `/api/admin/products/:id` | 409 with an explanation if the product appears in an order |
| `PUT` | `/api/admin/products/:id/variants` | Replace the size × colour matrix; unchanged pairs keep their row id |
| `POST` | `/api/admin/uploads` | Store a product image, returns `{url}`. PNG/JPEG/WebP/GIF/AVIF, 5 MB, **no SVG** |
| `GET` `PUT` | `/api/admin/settings` | Read / edit the homepage copy. Unknown keys are rejected, links are validated |
| `POST` | `/api/admin/settings/reset` | Reset some or all fields to their defaults |
| `GET` | `/api/admin/orders` · `GET`/`PATCH` `/api/admin/orders/:id[/status]` | Order queue and status changes |
| `GET` | `/api/admin/subscribers` | Newsletter list |

`GET /api/cart` returns server-computed money, so the checkout never re-implements the rules:

```json
{ "items": [...], "count": 2, "subtotal": 119.98, "shipping": 0,
  "tax": 9.6, "total": 129.58, "currency": "USD", "freeShippingThreshold": 99 }
```

### Creating an admin

```bash
npm run db:promote -- you@example.com   # after registering that address
```

---

## Design decisions worth knowing

* **The server owns the money.** Free shipping over $99, $9.99 flat, 8% tax — defined once
  in `backend/services/pricing.js`. The browser reads those numbers back from
  `GET /api/cart`; `src/utils/pricing.ts` is only used when the API is unreachable.
* **Everything interpolated into `innerHTML` goes through `escapeHtml()` / `safeUrl()`.**
  Product names come from the admin API, so they are treated as untrusted.
* **Offline-first cart.** If the API can't be reached the cart transparently moves to
  `localStorage`, shows an "offline" notice, and re-syncs when the connection returns.
  A *server rejection* (out of stock, validation) is **not** treated as offline — it surfaces.
* **Stock is checked twice** — when a line is added and again when the order is placed —
  and the whole order (header, lines, stock decrement, cart clear) runs in one transaction.
* **Admin routes require a real admin JWT.** There is no unauthenticated write path.
* **No inline scripts in the build**, so `helmet()`'s CSP works even when Express serves
  `frontend/dist` (`SERVE_STATIC=true`).

## Store admin

`admin.html` is the control room. It requires an account with the `admin` role; anyone else
gets a 403 and a sign-in gate. Once signed in as an admin, **Store admin** appears in the
header account menu. Deep links work: `admin.html#products`, `#content`, `#orders`,
`#subscribers`.

**Products** — add, edit and delete; toggle **Published** (invisible in the shop and
unreachable by URL when off) and **Featured** (drives the homepage grid) straight from the
table. The editor covers price, sale price, category, stock, description, feature bullets,
rating display, a main image and up to six gallery images — each either pasted as a URL or
**uploaded from your computer** — plus a size × colour stock grid that generates SKUs
automatically.

**Homepage** — edits the live storefront copy: an announcement bar, the hero eyebrow,
heading, subtitle, both buttons and their links, the hero image and its alt text, the three
trust badges, the featured-section heading and link, the newsletter block and the footer
blurb. Each section can be reset to its defaults individually.

The public pages pick this up through `data-setting` attributes:

```html
<h1 data-setting="heroTitle">Elevate Your Everyday Style</h1>
<a data-setting="heroCtaPrimaryLabel" data-setting-href="heroCtaPrimaryHref">Shop Now →</a>
<img data-setting-src="heroImage" data-setting-alt="heroImageAlt" src="…" alt="…" />
<div data-setting="announcement" data-setting-hide-when-empty="true" hidden></div>
```

`src/features/content/siteSettings.ts` applies them on boot. Text is written with
`textContent` and URLs pass through `safeUrl()`, and the server validates link-shaped
settings and rejects unknown keys — so a compromised admin account cannot inject markup or
a `javascript:` link into the storefront. To make another element editable, add one
`data-setting` attribute and one line to `DEFAULT_SETTINGS` in `backend/services/settings.js`.

**Orders** — the full queue with customer, total and an inline status selector.
**Subscribers** — the newsletter list, with copy-all.

Uploaded images land in `backend/uploads/` (git-ignored) and are served from `/uploads`
with `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` and a `default-src 'none'; img-src 'self' data:` CSP.
The Vite dev server proxies `/uploads` so previews work in development.

---

## Payments — demo gateway

`PAYMENT_PROVIDER` selects the driver (default `demo`). The app only ever talks to
`backend/services/payments.js`, so switching to Stripe means implementing that one module.

**Flow:** `POST /api/orders` creates the order as `pending_payment` and reserves stock →
the browser calls `POST /api/orders/:id/pay` with the card → the gateway authorises →
`paid` (+ `paid_at`, `card_last4`). A decline returns `402` and leaves the order payable,
so a retry never creates a duplicate. `POST /api/orders/:id/cancel` restocks.

**Demo cards** (the driver mirrors Stripe's test numbers):

| Card | Result |
|---|---|
| `4242 4242 4242 4242` | Succeeds |
| `4000 0000 0000 0002` | Declined |
| `4000 0000 0000 9995` | Insufficient funds |
| `4000 0000 0000 0069` | Expired card |
| `4100 0000 0000 0010` | Flagged as fraudulent |

Any other Luhn-valid number succeeds. The full card number is validated, used once and
discarded — **only the last four digits are stored**.

> ⚠️ **Before going live:** never send raw card numbers to this server. That brings the
> whole site into PCI-DSS scope. Set `PAYMENT_PROVIDER=stripe`, replace the card inputs
> with Stripe Elements, and flip orders to `paid` only from a signature-verified
> `payment_intent.succeeded` webhook. The `stripe` driver in `services/payments.js` is a
> starting point, not production-ready.

## Roadmap

`FIXPLAN.md` tracks every phase: what's fixed, what's next, and what's blocked on a
decision. Phases 1–5 are complete (blockers, security, repo hygiene, API wiring, accounts, demo
payments, admin panel); Phases 6–7 cover catalogue content and infrastructure.

## Tech notes

* Node **20+** (`node --test`, `--watch`, native ESM).
* `better-sqlite3` is a **native module**: after cloning, run `npm install` inside
  `backend/` so it builds/downloads for your platform. It cannot be copied between
  machines or architectures.
* The database is git-ignored. Create it with `npm run db:setup`.
* `frontend/dist` is git-ignored too — build it in CI or on the host.
